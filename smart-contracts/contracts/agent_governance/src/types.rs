//! # Governance and Vote Types
//!
//! Core data structures for the Agent Governance contract: agent stake records,
//! governance proposals, individual vote records, storage keys, and every event
//! payload emitted during the proposal lifecycle.
//!
//! ## Proposal Lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! create_proposal  →  vote_on_proposal (For | Against | Abstain)  →  execute_proposal
//!       ↓                                                                 ↓
//!    [Active] ──────────────────────────────────────────────→  [Executed] | [Failed]
//! ```
//!
//! ## Voting Power
//!
//! An agent's voting power is weighted by **both** its reputation score and its
//! staked amount:
//!
//! ```text
//! voting_power = stake + reputation * REPUTATION_POWER_UNIT
//! ```
//!
//! ### Snapshot point
//!
//! Both sides of the quorum check are measured at a single, documented point:
//! **the ledger timestamp at which the proposal was created**
//! (`Proposal::created_at`).
//!
//! * The quorum denominator (`total_power_snapshot`) is the electorate's
//!   aggregate power at that timestamp.
//! * Each vote's weight is the voter's power **as of that same timestamp**,
//!   read from a bounded per-agent checkpoint history
//!   ([`PowerCheckpoint`]). Raising reputation or stake after the proposal was
//!   created therefore cannot inflate a vote on it. Agents registered after
//!   the snapshot have zero weight on that proposal.
//!
//! Power changes recorded in the same ledger timestamp as proposal creation
//! are treated as having happened at the snapshot point.
//!
//! ## Passing Rules
//!
//! * **Quorum** — the power of all cast votes (For + Against + Abstain) must be
//!   at least [`QUORUM_BPS`] (30 %) of the snapshotted total voting power.
//! * **Majority** — For votes must be strictly more than [`MAJORITY_BPS`]
//!   (50 %) of the *decisive* votes (For + Against; abstentions excluded).
//!
//! ## Event Catalogue
//!
//! | Function            | topic[1]     | Data                    |
//! |--------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
//! | `create_proposal`  | `created`     | `ProposalCreatedEvent`  |
//! | `vote_on_proposal` | `vote_cast`   | `VoteCastEvent`         |
//! | `execute_proposal` | `executed`    | `ProposalExecutedEvent` |
//! | `execute_proposal` | `failed`      | `ProposalFailedEvent`   |
//! | `pause`            | `paused`      | `Address` (admin)       |
//! | `unpause`          | `unpaused`    | `Address` (admin)       |
//! | `set_admin`        | `admin_set`   | `(old, new)`            |
//! | `remove_agent`     | `agent_rm`    | `(agent, power)`        |
//!
//! ## Execution Payload
//!
//! `ParameterChange` and `ProtocolUpgrade` proposals carry an executable
//! payload: a `target` contract, a `function` name, and bounded `calldata`
//! (at most [`MAX_CALLDATA_LEN`] bytes). On a passing vote,
//! `execute_proposal` invokes `target.function(calldata)` from the governance
//! contract. `ParameterChange` proposals always target the configured
//! parameter registry. `expected_hash` (SHA-256 of `calldata`) is pinned at
//! creation and re-verified at execution to guard against payload drift.
